### Q: What a neuron does is:
A: It takes some inputs, one or more inputs, which are just numbers. It does some computation and it outputs some other number, which then could be an input to a second neuron. 

> When you're building an artificial neural network or deep learning algorithm, rather than building one neuron at a time, you often want to simulate many such neurons at the same time.

In this diagram, these neurons do collectively is input a few numbers, carry out some computation, and output some other numbers.
